# React Pokemon Catcher

This is a simple pokemon app that I made with React. You can choose a specific **Region**, **Location**, and an **Area** to explore and catch a **pokemon**.

I used [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to fetch the data from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) The RESTful Pok√©mon API.

## How to install

Make sure that you have [node.js]() installed.

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required packages. It usually comes installed with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Execute this script inside the project directory.

```bash
sudo npm install # Just add sudo if you encounter any problem.
```

## How to run

This script will run the app in the development mode and automatically opens a [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.


```bash
npm start # Runs the app
```
